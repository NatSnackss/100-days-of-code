# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 3rd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've finished the command line certifcate on Codecademy & I'm halfway finished with the Python 3 module.

**Thoughts** I'm starting to think about focusing on front-end. I love design and considered UI/UX for a while when I was in college, but I never felt I had the chops to go art school. So maybe front-end would be a great happy medium for me?
